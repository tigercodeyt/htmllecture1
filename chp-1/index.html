<!-- <!DOCTYPE html> =>  is a declaration that tells the web browser which version of HTML the document is written in. In this case, it's telling the browser that the document is written in HTML5, which is the latest version of HTML.

<html> => is the root element of an HTML document, which contains all other elements of the document. It is used to define the beginning and end of an HTML document. All other HTML elements must be a descendant of the <html> element.

<head> => is an HTML element that contains metadata about an HTML document. It is a container for elements such as <title>, <meta>, <link>, <style>, and <script>, which provide information that is not displayed on the web page itself but is used by the browser to display or understand the document.

<title> => is an HTML element that is used to define the title of an HTML document. The text inside the <title> element is displayed in the title bar of the browser window and is used by search engines to determine the content of the page. It is a required element in HTML, and should be placed inside the <head> element.


<body> => is an HTML element that represents the content of an HTML document. It is a container for all the visible content of the web page, such as text, images, videos, and other HTML elements. The <body> element should be placed after the <head> element in an HTML document.

All the content that you want to display on the web page should be placed inside the <body> element. This includes headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, forms, and any other HTML elements that you want to include on the page. The content inside the <body> element is what the user sees and interacts with when they visit the web page. -->
